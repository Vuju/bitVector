# bitVector

As part of the lecture "Advanced Data Structures" at the KIT we are to implement and advanced bit-vector. 

Run with:

```
python (path to ads_program.py) (path to inputfile) (path to outputfile)
```

Default values for the paths are "./src/input.txt" and "./src/output.txt". The output file will be overwritten and automatically be created if it doesn't exist yet.

Imports:
- time: measure execution time
- sys: grab commandline arguments (file paths)

I tried implementing the data structures as explained in the following videos:
